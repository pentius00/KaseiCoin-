The mars cryptocurrency!!


After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected me to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose you to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. You decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. You’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

### Step 1: Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract
